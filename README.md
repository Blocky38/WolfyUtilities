WolfyUtilities provides a vast amount of utils, apis for use in other Spigot plugins.
It allows you to create advanced **in-game GUIs** with tons of customization options.
Additionally it integrates a **Language API** to easily support multiple languages for the GUIs chat messages and more.

Other than that there are many other Utils and APIs that make steps in development of plugins easier.
For example, 
- a **Config API** to easily manage your configs. It supports YAML and JSON (The JacksonUtil makes it easy to use the Jackson library),
- **NMS API** to easily edit NBTTags of ItemsStacks and no need to use reflection,
- **Chat API** to send messages to players, console and also easily execute code on chat clicks,
- tons of Utils for ItemStacks and ItemBuilder,
- Database support for MySQL,
- and a lot more. 

Note: There is no documentation on how to use API yet, but it is planned for the near future.

Core API that provides an API and Utils for plugins based on Spigot.

**In the recent versions WolfyUtilities was redesigned.  
This repository only contains the platform independent API and Utils**  
That is in preparation to support other platforms like Sponge.

## Updates
Updates are planned to be released in their dedicated repositories in the future.  
For now, they might still be published here as a mirror.

## Common API
The common API is available via Maven.  
It is currently very spare and does not work on its own!

# Implementations
Usually you would use the platform dependent implementation to make use of the API and utils in your plugin.

## Spigot
The latest Spigot specific implementation (4.16-SNAPSHOT) is nearly completely backwards compatible with previous WolfyUtilities versions, except some internal changes.  
More info in the new repo: [WolfyScript/WolfyUtils-Spigot](https://github.com/WolfyScript/WolfyUtils-Spigot).

## Sponge
This implementation is still being planned and developed.  
No ETA yet!

More info about the API can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/WolfyScript/WolfyUtilities/wiki).
